# Tsunami-HySEA 1.2

## Introduction


HySEA (Hyperbolic Systems and Efficient Algorithms) is a high-performance package developed by the EDANYA group at the University of Málaga, Spain, for the simulation of geophysical flows.

Tsunami-HySEA is a module of HySEA to simulate tsunamis generated by earthquakes.

A Tsunami-HySEA SYCL version, with the same features as this CUDA version, is available here:

## Requirements

A CUDA-capable GPU

A recent CUDA version

NetCDF


## Compilation


1) Copy the file src/FindNetCDF.cmake into the CMake's shared modules directory.

2) Create the project files with CMake:

   `ccmake <src directory>`

   Set the parameter CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS to "-arch=sm_xx", where xx is the compute capability
   of the graphics card. In this web page, the compute capabilities of all the CUDA GPUs
   are shown:

   https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus

   For example, if a NVIDIA V100 is used, CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS should be set to "-arch=sm_70".

3) `make` (TsunamiHySEA should be created).


## Execution

-Example with initialization using Okada parameters:

 `TsunamiHySEA <path to Mediterranean/mediterranean.txt>`

 The NetCDF file mediterranean.nc is generated.


## File formats

The topobathymetry file is a NetCDF file with "lon" (or "x") and "lat" (or "y") variables in double precision, and the "z" variable (the topobathymetry) in single precision.

The initial state file, if provided, is a NetCDF file with the same format as the topobathymetry file. Water velocities are initialized to zero.

The file with the points for the time series is a text file with an integer indicating the number of points, followed by the longitude and latitude of all the points.
