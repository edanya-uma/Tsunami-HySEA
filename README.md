# TsunamiHySEA

## Introduction


HySEA (Hyperbolic Systems and Efficient Algorithms) is a high-performance package developed by the EDANYA group at the University of MÃ¡laga, Spain, for the simulation of geophysical flows.

Tsunami-HySEA is a module of HySEA to simulate tsunamis generated by earthquakes.


## Requirements

A CUDA-capable GPU

CUDA >= 5.0

NetCDF


## Compilation

1) Copy the file src/FindNetCDF.cmake into the CMake's shared modules directory.

2) Create the project files with CMake:

   ccmake <src directory>

   Set the parameter CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS to "-arch=sm_xx", where xx is the compute capability
   of the graphics card. In this web page, the compute capabilities of all the CUDA GPUs
   are shown:
  
   [https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus)
  
   For example, if a Tesla K40 is used, CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS should be set to "-arch=sm_35".

3) make (TsunamiHySEA should be created).


## Execution

TsunamiHySEA <path to Algeria/algeria.txt>

The NetCDF file algeria.nc is generated.


## File formats

The bathymetry file (.bat) is a binary file with double precision numerical values. For each volume, <longitude latitude bathymetry> are stored, ordered by rows and starting from the upper left corner.

The initial state file (.ini) is a binary file with double precision numerical values. For each volume, <eta qx qy> are stored, ordered by rows and starting from the upper left corner.
