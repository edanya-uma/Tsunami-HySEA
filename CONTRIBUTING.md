## Contributing as a user
### Reporting issues

A great way to contribute to Tsunami-HySEA is to send a detailed report when you encounter a problem. Sufficiently detailed reports are highly appreciate. A good report should allow us reproducing the issue. 

Go [here](https://github.com/edanya-uma/TsunamiHySEA/issues) and click on "New issue". Select either "Bug report" or "Feature request" and click on the corresponding "Get started" button. A new web page will pop up where you will need to fill in a template and give a descriptive title. Once it is done, click on "Submit new issue".


## Contributing as a developer

As we (EDANYA Group - UMA) are code developers currently we do not foresee direct contributions to Tsunami-HySEA code from external developers. In any case, if you have any idea, suggestion or you want to contribute as developer to the Tsunami-HySEA code please contact us at t_hysea@uma.es to talk us about your proposal.
